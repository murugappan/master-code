    3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 4.1, no license or other right is granted by Blackboard to Member under this Agreement.
</p><br/>
<p>
    5.2 <u>Ownership Rights in the Member Software</u>. Except as specifically set forth in this Agreement, Member retains all rights in the Member Software
    that it creates pursuant to this Agreement.
</p><br/>
<p>
    5.3 <u>Ownership Rights in Derivative Works</u>. All Derivative Works of the Blackboard Developer Software or the Blackboard Commercial Software shall be
    owned exclusively by Blackboard. All Derivative Works shall be deemed to be “works made for hire.” To the extent that title to the Derivative Works does

    title, and interest therein to Blackboard. Blackboard, however, shall grant and hereby grants to Member a non-transferable, non-exclusive,
    non-sublicenseable, limited right and license to use any such Derivative Works for the Purpose set forth in this Agreement during the Term and subject to
    the limitations set forth in Sections 3.1 and 3.5. In the event that Blackboard permits Member in writing to use non-employees to perform the obligations
    of Member under this Agreement, Member shall take all necessary action to secure on behalf of Blackboard all rights to the Derivative Works from such
    non-employees.

<p>
    6. <u>Confidentiality</u>.
</p><br/>
<p>
    6.1 <u>Nondisclosure and Nonuse</u>. For the Term of this Agreement, and for a period of one (1) year after termination or expiration of this Agreement,
    each Party receiving Confidential Information (the “<u>Receiving Party</u>”) from the disclosing Party (the “<u>Disclosing Party</u>”), including, but not
    limited to, materials containing Confidential Information, shall: (a) disclose such Confidential Information to only those directors, officers, employees,
    and agents of such Party (i) whose duties justify their need to know such information, and (ii) who have been clearly informed of their obligation to
    maintain the confidential, proprietary, and/or trade secret status of such Confidential Information; and (b) use such Confidential Information only for the
    Purpose set forth in this Agreement. Each Receiving Party shall treat Confidential Information as strictly confidential, and shall use the same care to
    prevent disclosure of such information as such Party uses with respect to its own confidential and proprietary information, which shall not be less than
    the care a reasonable person would use under similar circumstances. Notwithstanding the foregoing, this Section imposes no obligation upon the Receiving
    Party with respect to Confidential Information which it can establish by legally sufficient evidence: (a) was in the possession of, or was rightfully known
    by the Receiving Party without an obligation to maintain its confidentiality prior to receipt from the Disclosing Party; (b) is or becomes generally known
    to the public without violation of this Agreement by the Receiving Party; (c) is obtained by the Receiving Party in good faith from a third party having
    the right to disclose it without an obligation of confidentiality; or (d) is independently developed by the Receiving Party without the participation of
    individuals who have had access to the Confidential Information. Further, the Receiving Party may disclose Confidential information to the limited extent
    necessary to comply with the order of a court of competent jurisdiction or other governmental body or pursuant to applicable federal, state or local law,
    regulation, court order, or other legal process having authority over the Receiving Party, provided that the Receiving Party has first given written notice
    to the Disclosing Party of such disclosure requirement and, to the extent reasonably possible, has given the Disclosing Party an opportunity to contest
    such required disclosure at the Disclosing Party’s expense.
</p><br/>
<p>
    6.2 <u>Notice</u>. The Receiving Party will notify the Disclosing Party immediately in the event the Receiving Party learns of any unauthorized possession,
    use, or knowledge of the Confidential Information and/or materials containing Confidential Information and will cooperate with the Disclosing Party (at the
    Disclosing Party’s cost and expense) in any litigation against any third persons necessary to protect the Disclosing Party’s rights with respect to the
    Confidential Information and materials.
</p><br/>
<p>
    6.3 <u>Confidential Treatment of Agreement</u>. Except for press releases approved subject to Section 4.2, neither Party shall disclose the terms of this
    Agreement to any third party; provided, however, that either Party may disclose the terms of this Agreement to its affiliates, their professional advisors,
    board of directors or advisory board members, or any potential investor or acquirer of a substantial part of such Party’s business (whether by merger, sale
    of assets, sale of stock, or otherwise) that is bound by a written agreement to keep such terms confidential, or as may be required by law.
</p><br/>
<p>
    6.4 <u>Confidential Treatment of Disputes</u>. Member shall keep confidential the existence of any dispute, controversy, or claim arising out of or
    relating to this Agreement, or the breach thereof, or any arbitration thereof under Section 12.5, and the details of any such dispute, controversy, claim,
    or arbitration.
</p><br/>
<p>
    6.5 <u>Independent Creation of Technology</u>. Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude Blackboard from developing or acquiring the same or similar
    technology as Member, provided that Blackboard does not use Member’s Confidential Information in violation of this Agreement.
</p><br/>
<p>
    7. <u>Term</u><u>; Termination</u>.

<p>
    7.1 <u>Term</u>. The term of this Agreement shall commence as of the Effective Date (subject to Blackboard’s acceptance of this Agreement) and shall

    request to enter into a new agreement for a subsequent term.
</p><br/>
<p>
    7.2 <u>Termination</u>. Either Party may, at its option, terminate this Agreement prior to the end of the Term if a material default by the other Party is
    not cured or waived within thirty (30) days after receipt of a written notice of the default. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Blackboard may terminate this
    Agreement immediately by written notice in the event of a breach of Sections 2, 3, 5, 6, and/or 8 herein. Either Party may terminate this Agreement
    immediately following written notice to the other Party if the other Party: (a) ceases to do business in the normal course, (b) becomes or is declared
    insolvent or bankrupt, (c) is the subject of any proceeding related to its liquidation or insolvency (whether voluntary or involuntary), other than a
    reorganization under Chapter 11 of the Bankruptcy Code, which is not dismissed within ninety (90) calendar days, or (d) makes an assignment for the benefit
    of creditors. Notwithstanding the foregoing, Blackboard may terminate this Agreement without cause upon thirty (30) days’ prior written notice. Upon such
    termination without cause, Blackboard will provide a prorated refund of the unused portion of the Membership fee paid by Member pursuant to Section 8.1.
</p><br/>
<p>
    7.3 <u>Rights and Obligations upon Termination or Expiration</u>. Termination or expiration of this Agreement shall not relieve either Party of any
    obligation or liability accrued hereunder prior to or in connection with such termination or expiration, except as expressly provided herein. Upon

    Blackboard Developer Software and Administrator Information that were made available pursuant to this Agreement; (2) deliver to Blackboard or delete or
    destroy all copies of the Blackboard Developer Software, Developer Documentation, and Administrator Information; (3) cease Member Customer access to and/or

    termination of this Agreement, each Party shall turn over all Confidential Information and copies of marketing materials of the other Party and all
    documents or media containing any such Confidential Information and any and all copies or extracts thereof to the other Party, or, if appropriate, destroy,
    and attest to the destruction of, such Confidential Information. In addition, the Parties shall use commercially reasonable efforts to conclude existing
    projects in a manner that serves the best interests of the Blackboard Clients, at Blackboard’s reasonable determination.

    be payable in U.S. dollars.
</p><br/>
<p>
    8.3 <u>Late Fees</u>. Blackboard may charge interest on any overdue amounts at the lower of: (i) the highest permissible rate or (ii) 18% per annum,
    charged at 1.5% per month from the date on which such amount fell due until the date of payment, whether before or after judgment.<strong></strong>
</p><br/>
<p>
    8.4 <u>Taxes</u>. The fees hereunder do not include any sales, use, excise, import or export, value-added or similar tax or interest, or any costs
    associated with the collection or withholding thereof, or any government permit fees, license fees or customs or similar fees levied on the delivery of the
    Blackboard Developer Software hereunder or in connection with Member’s sales to Member Customers. Member will be responsible for payment of such applicable
    sales, use, excise, import or export, value-added or similar tax or interest at point of sale. If Member is exempt from any such taxes or fees, then such
    taxes or fees shall not be charged to Member upon Blackboard’s receipt of a copy of Member’s sales tax exemption certificate or VAT registration number.
    All payments due under this Agreement shall be made without any deduction or withholding, unless such deduction or withholding is required by any
    applicable law or regulation then in effect. If Member is required to deduct or withhold, it will promptly notify Blackboard of the requirement, timely pay
    the required deduction or withholding amount to the relevant tax authority, provide Blackboard with an official receipt, certified copy or other
    documentation acceptable to Blackboard evidencing payment, and pay to Blackboard the amount to which Blackboard is otherwise entitled under this Agreement,
    less the amount required to be deducted or withheld. In the event and to the extent that Blackboard is unable to claim an income tax credit equal to the
    amount deducted or withheld, Member shall pay Blackboard, within thirty (30) days following receipt of an invoice from Blackboard, the difference between
    the amount Blackboard would have received and retained in the absence of such required deduction or withholding and the amount previously paid by Member to
    Blackboard under this Agreement.
</p><br/>
<p>
    8.5 <u>Costs and Expenses</u>. Except for fees due to Blackboard under this Agreement and/or as otherwise specifically agreed to by the Parties, each Party
    will be responsible for its own expenses incurred in rendering performance under this Agreement, including without limitation, the cost of facilities, work
    space, computers and computer time, development tools and platforms, utilities management, personnel and supplies. Any costs of promotion and marketing
    shall be borne solely by the respective Party, and nothing in this Agreement shall be interpreted to require promotion of products or services through
    marketing media forms which either Party normally charges a fee to provide.
